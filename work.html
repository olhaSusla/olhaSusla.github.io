       <h5><i>1. Maintain a Balance between Work and Personal Life.</i></h5>
<p>If you can do this work at school, don't take the notebooks home, it would be better to work longer in the classroom than to take the work home.</p>

<h5><i>2. Let Students Know What's Going On</i></h5>
<p>I used to just hand out the books and start teaching, but it's a lot easier to get where you want to go if everyone's onboard. Students should know what they're going to learn, why they're learning it, and how it'll be evaluated. I also learned to use a rubric so that kids know right from the beginning how their work will be evaluated and, therefore, what they should strive for.</p>

<h5><i>3. Explain Procedures and Expectations</i></h5>
<p>It's a mistake to assume the students in your class know how to work in a group or how to behave on a field trip. However, most kids will cooperate if they know what they're supposed to do. Remember, as an educator, you have to teach not only the "what" but the "how."

<h5><i>4. How You Treat Students Matters</i></h5>
<p>What you say to students, or how you treat them, can make or break their day. Remember your student's won't always remember what you taught them, but they'll always remember how you treated them."</p>

<h5><i>5. Keep Your Sense of Humor</i></h5>
<p>I was so serious about being a good teacher, I didn't see the role humor could play in my classroom. After a few years though, when I had more skills and more confidence, I was able to let my guard down and actually be funny or silly. Even better, my students began to understand that they could make jokes now and then, and we could all laugh together.</p>
